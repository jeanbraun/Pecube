$ this is the input file for Pecube
$ you can add as many comment lines as you wish as long as they start with a dollar sign
$
$ (1) the name of the run (also the name of the folder in which the solution is stored)
$ should be 5 letter long
EXMP5

$ (2) the name of the topography file used (if the name is Nil topo is assume to be flat)
$     Otherwise the file should contain nx by ny points (see below) defining the topography in meters
$     Note that the evolution of this topography (in amplitude and offset) will be allowed to
$     change through time
$     If the name of the file ends with a slash "/", then Pecube will assume it is a directory
$     in which a series of topo files (in meters) are to be stored (one per time step), named topo0, topo1, etc
$     Pecube will also expect to find uplift rate files, named uplift0, uplift1, etc in which an
$     uplift rate value (in km/Myr) will be stored for each location; similary a set of surface
$     temperature files will be expected, named temp0, temp1, etc in °C
$     When this second option is activated, the topography amplification and offset factors are not used
$     if the number of points in the longitude and latitude directions (next input line)  are negative, the number of points in the 
$     longitude direction (nx) will in fact correspond to the total number of points; the points defining
$     the topography will be assumed to be randomly distributed (not on a rectangular grid);
$     the number of points in the latitude direction (ny) will contain the number of triangles connecting
$     the randomly distributed points.
$     the topography file should then contain nx triplets of longitude, latitude and height of each point
$     followed by ny triplets of integer numbers between 1 and nx giving the triangular connectivity
Whataroa.dat

$ (3) the number of points in the longitude and latitude directions, respectively
$     if they are negative, they correspond to the total number of points and the number of triangles connecting them
121 74

$ (4) the spacing in degrees of longitude and latitude, respectively
$     This is not used in case nx and ny are negative (random grid)
0.00833333 0.00833333

$ (5) a skipping factor (1 means all points of the topography are used; 2 means that
$     every second point is used etc). Note that nx, ny AND nskip define the resolution of the
$     finite element grid in the horizontal directions
$     again this is not used in case nx and ny are negative (random grid)

$ (6) the longitude and latitude of the bottom left corner of the topo file
170 -43.7

$ (7) the number of time steps in the tectonomorphic scenario
3

$ (8) the erosional time scale (exponential decay rate of topography)
0.

$ (9) for each time step +1:
$ (a) a starting time (in Myr in the past)
$ (b) an amplification factor for the topography
$ (c) an offset factor (in km), 
$ (d) an output flag (for this time step: 0=no output / 1=output)
10. 0. 0. 1
6. 0. 0. 1
4. 1. 0. 1
0. 1. 0. 1

$ (10) a flag for isostasy (1 isostasy on; 0 isostast off)
$ crustal density (in kg/m3), mantle density (kg/m3), Young modulus (in Pa), poisson's
$ ratio, elastic plate thickness (in km), size of the FFT grid for elastic rebound
$ calculations (typically 1024 1024 but must be a power of 2)
0 2700.,3200.,1.d11,0.25,28.8,1024,1024

$ (11) the model thickness (in km), number of points in the z direction, thermal diffusivity in km2/Myr,
$ temperature at the base of the model (in C), temperature at z=0 (in C), atmospheric lapse rate (in
$ C/km), heat production in C/My
25.,31,25.,550,0.,0.,0.

$ (12) name of the file containing the thermochronological data
$ if Nil no date
$ otherwise it should contain the number of data points (locations)
$ for each location a line containing sample longitude, latitude, elevation
$ as well as Apatite He age, error in age, Apatite FT age, error in age
$ with a negative age corresponding to a non-existing age
Nil

$ (13) the default age (in Myr) for rocks that never reach the closure temperature, a flag to decide which 
$ apatite FT routine to use (0 = van der Beek or 1 = Ketcham), a flag to decide whether (flag=0) to use the absolute
$ age difference (between observed and predicted ages) to construct the misfit function or (flag=1) the difference in
$ the slope of the age-elevation relationship (for each system), a flag to decide whether (flag=0) the faults'geometry
$ is updated due to the movement on other faults or (flag=1) not
100 0 0 0 0

$ (14) a series of 9 flags to determine which age (system) has to be computed from the thermal histories
